  <p>
 Welcome to my GitHub account! I am a programmer and a student at 42 Abu Dhabi Programming School, where I am learning the C, C++ programming language. I am also interested in learning other languages such as JavaScript and Python, and I am particularly interested in blockchain development.

On my GitHub account, you will find my projects that I have developed during my studies at 42 Abu Dhabi. These projects showcase my skills and experiences in C, C++, JavaScript and Python programming and my interest in blockchain development. You can also find information about me and my interests in the field of programming.

Thank you for visiting my GitHub account, and please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or suggestions. I am always looking to learn and grow as a programmer, and I am open to collaborating with others in the developer community.
